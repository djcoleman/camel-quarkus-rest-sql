# Camel Quarkus REST SQL Example
A Camel Quarkus example that demonstrates how to use SQL via JDBC along with Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API. This example was ported to the Camel Quarkus platform from https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql.

## What Does It Do?

A back-end service runs a Camel route that periodically creates new `Book` orders and stores them in a database table. Another Camel route then polls the database for new orders and proccesses them.

A front-end REST API is made available to query the list of unique books in the database, and retrieve details of a particular order.

## Running the Example

You can either run the example locally, or remotely on a Kubernetes/OpenShift node.

### Running Locally

To run the example locally, you need the following pre-requisites:

  * JDK 17+
  * Maven 3.8+

You can build and run the example in `dev` mode with the following command:

```bash
mvn quarkus:dev
```

Running in `dev` mode means that any changes made to the sources will automatically get rebuilt and redeployed when they're saved. Also, in this example Quarkus will automatically launch a MariaDB database and load the schema.

The first build may take a few minutes to download the dependencies and fetch the database container, but you should start to see log messages similar to the following:

```
2023-07-25 13:58:56,237 INFO  [generate-order] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - timer://new-order) Inserted new order 1
2023-07-25 13:59:06,167 INFO  [generate-order] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - timer://new-order) Inserted new order 2
2023-07-25 13:59:16,164 INFO  [generate-order] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - timer://new-order) Inserted new order 3
2023-07-25 13:59:26,170 INFO  [generate-order] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - timer://new-order) Inserted new order 4
2023-07-25 13:59:26,247 INFO  [process-order] (Camel (camel-1) thread #1 - sql://select%20*%20from%20orders%20where%20processed%20=%20false) Processed order #id 1 with 9 copies of the 'ActiveMQ in Action' book
```

The following REST endpoints will be available when the example is running:

  * http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books/ - The list of unique book titles.
  * http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1 - The details of the first order.
  * http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/api-doc - The OpenAPI documentation of the available endpoints.

### Deploying on Kubernetes/OpenShift with Odo

[Odo](https://odo.dev/) is a CLI tool that simplifies the workflow when working with containerised applications running on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Pre-requisites:

  * [Odo](https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation)
  * A Kubernetes or OpenShift node/cluster, for example `minikube` running locally, or a free account with Red Hat's [Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox).

When running in the developer Sandbox, the default namespace could be used.
However for other kubernetes flavors, please create a new default namespace as below:
```bash
odo create namespace camel-quarkus-rest-sql
```

To run the application in development mode, just run the following command:

```bash
odo dev --port-forward 8080:8080
```

The `odo dev` command is driven by the contents of the `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory. The devfile format is described at https://devfile.io, but there are two key sections for this deployment. The `component` sections describe containers that will be started, and the `command` sections describe which commands will be run in the containers. There are two container components for this project - a `java` component that will run the `mvn` command to build and run the example, and a `mariadb` component that will run the database server.

The `prepare-database` command populates the database with the contents of `src/main/resources/schema.sql`, which creates the `orders` table used by the example. This command is triggered by the `postStart` event once the containers are running.

The second command is the `mvn quarkus:dev` command that builds and starts the example, and is executed during the run phase.

Finally, the `--port-forward 8080:8080` option maps port 8080 on the pod to the same port number on your local machine so that you can access the endpoints using the same URLs as if running locally.

#### Debugging

You can start the example in debug mode so that you can attach to it from your IDE by running the following command:

```bash
odo dev --debug --port-forward 5005:5005 --port-forward 8080:8080 
```


### Red Hat OpenShift Dev Workspaces 

You can access the Dev Workspaces from a [Developer Sandbox](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) account. From the Developer Console that should be visible after logging in to your OpenShift account, select the _Applications_ grid icon at the right of the menu bar, and  then select _Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces_ from the drop-down menu. This will open the Dev Workspaces dashboard in a new tab.

You should see the _Create Workspaces_ pane - if not, select that option from the sidebar. In the _Import from Git_ box, enter the URL `https://github.com/djcoleman/camel-quarkus-rest-sql` and hit return to create a workspace. This will open in a new browser tab.

The workspace should look familar to anyone who has used Visual Studio Code before. The contents of the GitHub Repository specified in the previous step will be cloned into the workspace, and the two containers in the DevFile will have been started. You can verify this in the _Topology_ page in the Developer Console tab by clicking on the workspace deployment and then clicking on _Pods_, you should see the `java` and `mariadb` containers running.

The commands from the DevFile have been added as tasks in the VS Code editor. To build and run the quickstart:
  1. Click on the Burger icon in the top left corner of the editor to open the menu.
  2. Select _Terminal -> Run Task..._
  3. In the _Select task to run_ pop-up, search from `devfile: run-quickstart`. A terminal will open and the command will be executed.

Once the compilation has completed and the example is running, you will be asked whether you want to add a redirect for port 8080. Click _Yes_ to this pop-up, and the subsequent one asking whether you wish to open a tab to the redirect. Your URL will contain the application name `camel-quarkus-rest-sql` in the subdomain, with a domain of `openshiftapps.com`. Once the example is running, you should be able to append `/camel-rest-sql/books/` to this URL to view the list of books.


## Code Tours

When the project is open in VS Code / Eclipse Che / Red Hat Dev Spaces, there are two code tours available - an `Introduction` tour that walks through running the example, and a `Developers` tour that provides a walk-through of the implementation.

To view the code tours, you'll need to install the `CodeTour` plugin by Jonathan Carter. Once installed, a `CODETOUR` section will appear in the Explorer side panel from where you can launch one of the code tours.
